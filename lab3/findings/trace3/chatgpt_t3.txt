**Red Flags to Notice:**

1. **Urgency:** The email creates a sense of urgency to prompt quick action.
2. **Generic Greeting:** It may not use your name or could be addressed incorrectly.
3. **Suspicious Links:** Hovering over the link shows a different URL than expected.
4. **Poor Grammar:** Phishing emails often have typos or awkward phrasing.
5. **Unusual Sender Address:** Check the email address; it may look similar but not quite right.

Always verify directly with the organization if you're unsure!
